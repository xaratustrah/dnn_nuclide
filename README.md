# nuclident

Nuclidic identification with deep learning methods and neural networks using [TensorFlow](https://github.com/xaratustrah/barion) / [TFLearn](http://tflearn.org/) for identification of nuclidic masses and species in heavy ion storage rings based on experimental atomic mass database [AMDC](https://www-nds.iaea.org/amdc/).

This program uses [barion](https://github.com/xaratustrah/barion), a library for easy calculations based on AMDC and [iqtools](https://github.com/xaratustrah/iqtools) for extraction of data from Schottky detectors. Combined together

**This code is a work in progress:**

Currently the variation on the momentum compaction factor (alpha_p curve) is not implemented in the calculation. This limits the use of this code to very close lying spectral peaks.
