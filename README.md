# nuclident

Nuclidic identification using Deep learning methods and neural networks using [TensorFlow](https://github.com/xaratustrah/barion) / [TFLearn](http://tflearn.org/) for identification of nuclidic masses and species in heavy ion storage rings based on experimental atomic mass database [AMDC](https://www-nds.iaea.org/amdc/). This script uses [barion](https://github.com/xaratustrah/barion), a library for easy calculations based on AMDC.
